# Analysing the relevance of features for a social navigation task - 2015

Focus on social robot movement in order to reach a person target walking through a indoor scene
and trying to keep the most natural velocity and orientation as possible. This paper model a supervised learning
approach choosing the best features described below in order to classify a robot movement as "go" or "return" way,
which means that a "go" label is a more realistic way of robot interaction:

– Average Distance To Closest Person

– Average Relative Velocity To Closest Person

– Average Relative Orientation To Closest Person

– Average Angle To Closest Person

– Average robot’s linear velocity

– Average robot’s angular velocity

# A systematic review of Adaptivity in human-robot interaction - 2017

Survey-based paper with a lot of cases of human-robot interaction adaptivity with goals of improve 1-1 conversation, emotion expressions and gestures.
This work have a huge number of references that brings content related to different subjects such as healthcare, education, public places and home.
Most of them refers to robots that try to find persons in a room or public space, beginning some kind of interaction after that and keeping long-term
conversation or 1-1 contact, independent if this persons were busy or not.

Interesting papers cited that cover the importance of improving engagement between robot and human:

- Machine Learning for Social Multiparty Human-Robot Interaction - 2014

Use of location, facial expressions, gaze behavior and body language features to start or not interaction in bartender context (SSR).

- May i help you?: Design of human-like polite approaching behavior - 2015

Models tree types of possible actions of robots that are active, proactive and passive interactions in shopping malls.

# Evaluating the engagement with social robots - 2015

Assumes only face to face interaction but uses similar sensors such as RGBD data and features such as gaze, head position, body posture, movement velocity.
Shows the importance of non-verbal features and could be useful to get information considering one person methodology.

# Human-aware Robot navigation survey - 2013

Survey-based with a huge number of theory behind HRI that could bring many different words specific to this subject.
Some of these terms are:

- human friendly navigation: usually it refers to navigate in a environment keeping a safe distance from humans and obstacles

- human-like motion behavior: Refering to robot movements in accordance with crowded places

Also, a summary of capabilities are described and some references made related to:

- respect personal zones

- respect affordance spaces

- avoid culturally scorned upon behaviors

- avoid erratic motions or noises that cause distraction

- reduce velocity when approaching a person

- approach from the front for explicit interaction

- modulate gaze direction

Example of labels cited to think about:

- the robot selects an action (e.g. go to human)
- the robot selects a pose (e.g. in front of human)
- the robot selects a path (e.g. avoiding a group of people talking
to each other)
- the robot adapts an aspect of behavior while moving on the path
(e.g. reducing speed to avoid noise near persons)

# Robot navigation in large-social social maps: An action recognition approach - 2016

This work proposes an integrated robot framework that allows navigation in
a human populated environment. This work employs the performed actions of individuals
so as to re-plan and design a collision-free and at the same time a socially acceptable trajectory.
It tries to recognize person/environment and group activity (working, conversation, walking) in order to give the proper
action to the robot (focus on movements to avoid collisions in a naturalistic way).

# Service robots: System design for tracking people through data fusion and initiating interaction with the human group by inferring social situations - 2016

Designed to work with multiple persons and recognition features such as number of legs, face recognition and human torsos and shoulders.
Models social situations described below and tries to start an interaction based on these:

- individual-to-robot: acts paying attention
- individual-to-individual: asks if need something in discrete way
- confidential discussion : don't interrupt
- group-to-robot: acts paying attention
- robot-to-individual : acts asking something or help
- robot-to-group : acts asking something or help
- group discussion : don't interrupt
