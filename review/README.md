# Human-Robot Interaction / Social Robot - Papers Analysis

Below, some papers related to this project will be reviewed and their content described in few words.

# Analysing the relevance of features for a social navigation task - Spain

Focus on social robot movement in order to reach a person target walking through a indoor scene
and trying to keep the most natural velocity and orientation as possible. This paper model a supervised learning
approach choosing the best features described below in order to classify a robot movement as "go" or "return" way,
which means that a "go" label is a more realistic way of robot interaction:

– Average Distance To Closest Person
– Average Relative Velocity To Closest Person
– Average Relative Orientation To Closest Person
– Average Angle To Closest Person
– Average robot’s linear velocity
– Average robot’s angular velocity

# A systematic review of Adaptivity in human-robot interaction - Australia

Survey-based paper with a lot of cases of human-robot interaction adaptivity with goals of improve 1-1 conversation, emotion expressions and gestures.
This work have a huge number of references that brings content related to different subjects such as healthcare, education, public places and home.
Most of them refers to robots that try to find persons in a room or public space, beginning some kind of interaction after that and keeping long-term
conversation or 1-1 contact, independent if this persons were busy or not.
